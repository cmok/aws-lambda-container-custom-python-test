# aws-lambda-container-custom-python-test

This test sample code is from the *Build a Custom Image for Python* section of [New for AWS Lambda - Container Image Support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/)

The *random-letter* section doesn't seem to work now due to the troublesome of Node modules.
